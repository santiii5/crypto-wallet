The goal of this challenge is to evaluate your ability to:

- Design and implement a polished world-class user experience
- Think independently and create new user interfaces based on an existing design language
- Write clear and maintainable code


# Functionalities

As an open-ended challenge the possibilities are endless, but a minimum functional layout should be enough code to test.

The functionality implemented until now allows to:

- View your wallet page with your account info
- Open the transfer panel
- Open and use the address of contacts Agenda
- Complete the transfer

Some features have been developed around the main functionalities, like adding the done transfers to the current wallet view or a success transfer message with a light panel animation.


# Structure and comments

The app is composed by 5 components sharing props between parent components and child components.
The styles are done with SCSS, with global accessible variables and some global styles.
At the beginning I used a grid layout but later I removed it.


# How could this project be improved?

As you know this is my first project with Vue 2, and although I achieved the goal of the test I am not fully concerned about the best ways to structure the code for the best performance and scalability.
There are still some TODOs to solve, but the main functionalities are fully working.
